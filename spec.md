# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - My CLI class provides menu options and instructions for the user
- [X] Pull data from an external source - I pull data from the Wikipedia wine tasting page and the pages for 36 different grape varieties.
- [X] Implement both list and detail views - The list view only includes the wine grapes list. The details view includes the tasting descriptors (also from the main wine tasting page), the grape color and regions (which both come from the individual grape's wikipedia page)
